Hey guys. This is part of a series of practices that I will be uploading so you can see my skills, abilities and knowledge. Also as a guide for those who are just starting out and who knows someone might like what I do.

We have a model of boxes inspired by a yoga class with the main movements to inspire us. It's not all about mental effort!
Leave me a comment if you want to know more. Chau.
